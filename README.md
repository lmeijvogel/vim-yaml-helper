# My Yaml helper

## Introduction

This is a plugin that adds some methods for traversing Yaml files:

- Moving to the parent node ( `:YamlParent` or just `:YamlP` ),
- Getting the full path to the current element ( `:YamlFullPath` or just `:YamlF` ),
- Moving to an element, given the path ( `:YamlGoToKey some.path` or just `:YamlG some.path` )
